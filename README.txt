#### Simple experiment with classes in JS

Trying to plan a project on a foodie app with a back end for saving data. 
Using classes to experiment with how to plan for data creation and facilitate binding functionality to the data to be saved. 

There is a user class >> to instantiate the user
a client class, extending user >> to instantiate more individual data ie preferences
perhaps I will add an admin extending from user and or client.
